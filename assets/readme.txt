Project: School Fees Payment System using PHP/MySQLi with Source Code

About
The School Fees Payment System is a simple PHP/MySQLi project that may help a certain school manage their student's fee payments. This project stores fees per course and level. Talking about the fees per course and level, each course and level list the detailed calculation of the school fees, which means the fees per course and level can have multiple lists such as the tuition, miscellaneous, and other types of fees for the certain course and level. The school fees payment system also stores the student list and the list of student fees which means on the Student Fees list, it is possible that a certain student has a double entry which is not because they have a different Enrollment Number or EF. No. and this field are to identify the payable fee of the student per semester although there is no section or feature in this project for managing the semester of the school which is why I only use the enrollment number. The payment feature in this project has only a simple process which is enough for managing the payment, generate a receipt, and generate the payment summary per student's semester. This project also generates monthly payment reports for school management reference purposes.
